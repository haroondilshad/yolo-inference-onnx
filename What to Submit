What to Submit
• Video Link or File: Your full walkthrough.
• Short Written Summary:
• How you set up your environment.
• Which Al tools you used and how they helped.
• Your steps for PyTorch inference, ONNX conversion, and ONNX inference.
• A brief note on the outputs you observed (e.g., detected objects, bounding boxes).
Evaluation Criteria for AI.SEE
• Completeness: Did you successfully run inference in both PyTorch and ONNX?
• Environment Setup: How well did you configure everything from scratch?
• Al Tool Usage: How effectively you use Al-assisted coding.
• Clarity of Explanation: The detail and clarity in your "think aloud" process.
• Correctness of Outputs: Are the bounding boxes/labels (or any other output) sensible?
