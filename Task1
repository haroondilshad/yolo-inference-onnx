Context
You will receive two files:
• yolo11n.pt - a YOLO model in PyTorch format.
• image.png - a sample image to test against.
Your assignment has two main tasks
1. Predict (image.png ) using the given YOLO model.
2. Convert the yolo11n.pt model to ONNX and then use the converted ONNX model to run inference on the same image.png.
Detailed Instructions - Environment Setup from Scratch
• Create a new development environment (e.g., a fresh Python virtual environment or Docker container).
• Install all libraries required to run the PyTorch model and to perform the ONNX conversion (e.g., torch, onnx, onxruntime, etc.).
• Mandatory: Use Al-assisted coding tools such as Windsurf, Cursor Pro (newest versions) to expedite your coding process. Explain in your video how you leveraged these Al tools.
Inference with the PyTorch Model
• Load the yolo11n.pt model in PyTorch.
• Run inference on image.png and output the results, such as bounding box coordinates, labels, and/or a labeled output image showing detections.
Convert the Model to ONNX
• Convert the PyTorch model (yolo11n. pt ) to ONNX format.
• Ensure the ONNX model is valid by using it for inference in your environment.
Inference with the ONNX Model
• Once the conversion is successful, use the ONNX model to run inference on image.png again.
• Output the results in a human-readable format (e.g., console logs, bounding box overlays, etc.).
