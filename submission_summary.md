# YOLO Model Inference and ONNX Conversion Summary

## Environment Setup
- Created Python virtual environment (`python -m venv venv`)
- Installed dependencies: PyTorch, ONNX, ONNX Runtime, OpenCV, Ultralytics via requirements.txt

## AI Tools Used
- **Cursor Pro** assisted with:
  - Code structure, PyTorch model loading issues, preprocessing steps
  - Resolving PyTorch 2.6 security restrictions
  - Building fallback mechanisms for both PyTorch and ONNX workflows

## Implementation Steps

### PyTorch Inference
- Loaded YOLO model (yolo11n.pt) with security handling for PyTorch 2.6
- Converted half precision to full precision
- Preprocessed image, ran inference, drew bounding boxes

### ONNX Conversion
- Used Ultralytics YOLO.export with appropriate parameters
- Successfully created yolo11n.onnx (10.2 MB)

### ONNX Inference
- Loaded model with ONNX Runtime
- Preprocessed image, ran inference, visualized results

## Observed Outputs
- Successfully detected: 1 person, 2 cars, 2 giraffes
- Both PyTorch and ONNX models produced similar results
- Comparison visualization (comparison_results.png) confirms consistent detection

The project successfully demonstrates the complete workflow from PyTorch to ONNX inference with proper error handling and visualization.
